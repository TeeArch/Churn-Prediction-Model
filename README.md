# 📊 Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project is a Churn Prediction web application built using **Streamlit** and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model trained with TensorFlow/Keras. It allows users to either upload a CSV file of customer data for batch prediction or manually enter customer details for single prediction.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dual Input Mode:**
  - 📁 Upload CSV file for batch predictions.
  - 📝 Manually enter customer details for single prediction.
- ⚡ Real-time predictions using a pre-trained ANN model.
- 🧩 One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (Geography and Gender) matches model training.
- 📊 Intuitive user interface with clear instructions.
